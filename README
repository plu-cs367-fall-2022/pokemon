# Pokemon Database

This is a postgres database supporting a Pokemon dataset from [The Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon) from Kaggle.

It's intended to be run from Docker, and contains the postgres database as well as an instance of [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

## Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## How to run

from the root directory of this repository:

```
docker compose up
```

## How to use

### Logging in

Once Docker has finished loading, open a browser to [localhost:5050](localhost:5050)

Sign in with the credentials found in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:
email: admin@admin.com
password: root

### First-time setup

Click the "Add New Server" button under Quick Links and enter the following fields:
General -> Name: pg_container
Connection -> Host name/address: pg_container
Username: postgres
Password: password
Save Password?: true

You should now see `pg_container` under the `Servers` section in the left menu. You can drill down into `pg_container -> Databases -> pokemon -> Schemas -> Tables` and find the `pokemon` table.

### Making Queries

Right click on the `Servers -> pg_container -> Databases -> pokemon` section from the explorer menu and select `Query Tool`. This will open a text editor where you can make queries.

Try it out by typing `select count(*) from pokemon` and clicking the execute/refresh button (or hitting F5).

Happy querying!
